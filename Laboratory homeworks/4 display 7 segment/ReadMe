This is the code for the 4 display 7 segment controlled by a joystick.
You can select the display number using the xAxis and the switch button (the current display is indicated by the lit decimalpoint).
Doing this will enter the lockedOn mode.
While in lockedOn mode (flashing decimalpoint)you can increase/decrease the number shown on the display using the yAxis.
Hitting the switch again will save the number on the display and re-enter the cycling mode.
